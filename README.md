# Kata01: Supermarket Pricing

The purpose of this project is to implement a platform that would allow adding items to a cart and then
applying discounts on this cart.

The questions like:

    does fractional money exist?
    when (if ever) does rounding take place?
    how do you keep an audit trail of pricing decisions (and do you need to)?
    are costs and prices the same class of thing?
    if a shelf of 100 cans is priced using “buy two, get one free”, how do you value the stock?

Are out of the scope of this project and should be handled separately.

Sample discounts used here are:

- three for a dollar
- buy two, get one free

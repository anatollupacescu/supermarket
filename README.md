Supermarket app that allows adding items to a cart and then applying discounts on this cart.

### Feedback ###

The app does not cover this questions:

* does fractional money exist?
* when (if ever) does rounding take place?
* how do you keep an audit trail of pricing decisions (and do you need to)?
* are costs and prices the same class of thing?
* if a shelf of 100 cans is priced using “buy two, get one free”, how do you value the stock?
